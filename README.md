Fortnite replay parser.

The only thing that it don't parse is the Network packets.  
Currently no data is really read, I just try to "burn" the data correctly.
More docs is also needed

This code is mine and you need my authorization to use it.  
I will put a MIT license on this repository two month or less after my website using this parser go live.
